## Functionality

This is the [binary search tree](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees) project, which introduces BST as data structures.

## Methods

| Method        | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| #build_tree(arr) | Returns a BST constructed from the passed array |
| #insert(value) | Inserts a value into the constructed BST |
| #delete(value) | Deletes a value from the constructed BST |
| #find(value) | Accepts a value and returns the node with the given value if found |
| #level_order | Accepts block and yields each node to block in breadth-first level order |
| #inorder | Accepts block and yields each node with inorder traversal
| #preorder |  Accepts block and yields each node with preorder traversal |
| #postorder | Accepts block and yields each node with postorder traversal |
| #height(node) | Accepts a node and returns its height in the BST |
| #depth(node) | Accepts a node and returns its depth in the BST |
| #balanced? | Returns true if the tree is balanced and false otherwise |
| #rebalance | Rebalances an unbalanced tree |
| #pretty_print | Provided method to print tree in console |
